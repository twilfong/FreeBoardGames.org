Checkers is a board game for two players. It is played in a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side.

Each player starts with twelve pieces. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Normal pieces can move only diagonally towards the opponent's side, while kings can move in any direction. A player can remove an opponent's piece from the board by jumping over it.

In order to jump, the next diagonal square after the opponent piece must be empty. If the player has more than one possible jump, these jumps can be executed in a single turn. A piece becomes a king if a piece reaches the last row towards the opponent. The game ends when no more pieces or moves are possible for a player.
